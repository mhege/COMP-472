Looking at the standard deviation of the accuracy, macro-average, and weighted-average,
the models that changed metric values in successive runs are: Base-MLP, Top-MLP.
The models that remained the same are: GNB, Base-DT, Top-DT, PER.

The multilayer perceptron changes results due to randomly assigning weights. Therefore,
it converges to different metric results each time.

Since the perceptron doesn't change results, it must be initialized with the same weights.
The gaussian naive baye's and decision tree models always converge to the same result fundamentally.
